  <details><summary>If God has a divine plan/blueprint for the Universe, how does man have free will?</summary></details>
  <details><summary>If God knows our choices before we make them, is free will just an illusion?</summary></details>
  <details><summary>If God already knows who is going to Heaven or Hell, why create those who are going to Hell?</summary></details>
  <details><summary>Can prayer change God's will? If so, how is God's will perfect and unchanging?</summary></details>

<details><summary>Why are there verses in the Bible that condone slavery, misogyny, and genocide?</summary></details>
<details><summary>How do we decide which biblical commands are cultural and which are eternal?</summary></details>
<details><summary>Can the Bible be considered perfect if humans selected which books would be in it?</summary></details>

<details><summary>Why has religion caused so much war and division?</summary></details>
<details><summary>Are religions created more for control than truth?</summary></details>
<details><summary>If religious leaders have been corrupt throughout history, how can we trust religious teachings?</summary></details>
