<h1>Questions About God</h1>
  
<h2 id="free-will">Free Will & Divine Plan</h2>
<details><summary>If God has a divine plan/blueprint for the Universe, how does man have free will?</summary><p>If all events are predestined, does that make any choice we make just an illusion? This question highlights the tension between divine sovereignty (God's control over everything) and human autonomy (the ability to make free choices). If all outcomes are already determined, can true responsibility exist?</p></details>
<details><summary>If God knows our choices before we make them, is free will just an illusion?</summary><p>If God already knows what we will choose, does that make our decisions inevitable? This raises the philosophical question: Does God's foreknowledge cause our choices, or does it merely anticipate them?</p></details>
<details><summary>If God already knows who is going to Heaven or Hell, why create those who are going to Hell?</summary><p>This question probes divine justice and intention. If some are born into a fate of eternal punishment, the act of creation itself could be construed as cruel or unnecessary—unless there's some higher justification we're not privy to.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can prayer change God's will? If so, how is God's will perfect and unchanging?</summary><p>This introduces a paradox: if prayer can influence God, then His will isn't fixed; if it can’t, then why pray? Either outcome seems to undermine traditional beliefs about the power of prayer or the nature of God.</p></details>
<details><summary>If everything happens for a reason (under God's control), are we truly responsible for our actions?</summary><p>If divine orchestration governs all events, moral accountability becomes blurred. Can we be judged for actions we were ultimately caused or destined to perform? There are reasons why things occur; however, there is no evidence to suggest that the events that befall humans—whether negative or positive—happen for any particular reason or purpose.</p></details>

<h2 id="hell">Hell, Morality & Eternal Justice</h2>
<details><summary>When the believer gets to Heaven, how can Heaven be blissful if the believer's loved ones are suffering eternally in Hell?</summary><p>This question touches on the emotional paradox of eternal joy coexisting with eternal loss. Does divine bliss require emotional detachment or forgetfulness? Would the Christian God need to change who we are in order for us to accept that people we love are burning in Hell forever? If so, can such a <a href="https://www.infidelguy.com/is-heaven-the-sky" target="new">Heaven</a> be considered loving or just? Additionally, who would we be if we had to be changed to accept it?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a loving God send anyone to Hell? Based on what?</summary><p>This raises questions about the meaning of love, divine justice, and moral thresholds. What actions, beliefs, or lack thereof merit infinite punishment? Is there room for reform, or is the sentence final? Even if love is conditional, would such a minor infraction—such as not believing in God—merit eternal torment?</p></details>
<details><summary>"God is merciful," we hear quite often. Wouldn’t a merciful God simply forgive everyone and not send anyone to Hell?</summary><p>If mercy is unconditional, shouldn’t it extend to all? This question probes whether mercy can coexist with vengeance, or if our definitions are shaped more by tradition than consistency.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is eternal punishment just? Isn’t that overkill?</summary><p>This question scrutinizes the proportionality of divine justice. Does any finite wrongdoing warrant unending suffering? Or is this more reflective of human legalism projected onto the divine?</p></details>
<details><summary>Wouldn’t it be more merciful for God to simply destroy the souls of the wicked rather than burn them forever?</summary><p>This considers annihilationism as an alternative to eternal torment. Which better reflects a morally coherent deity—cessation or everlasting suffering?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is Hell a place of literal fire, or is it metaphorical? Why the imagery of fire?</summary><p>The fire motif may have metaphorical or cultural roots. Does it reflect divine wrath, purification, or a literal torment? The ambiguity leaves room for interpretation, some symbolic, others terrifyingly real.</p></details>
<details><summary>How is eternal punishment reconciled with crimes committed in finite time?</summary><p>This question scrutinizes proportionality. Can infinite consequences for limited deeds be morally justified, or does such a framework collapse under modern ethical reasoning?</p></details>

<h2 id="bible">The Bible & Revelation</h2>
<details><summary>How can we be sure the Bible is the inspired Word of God?</summary><p>This question probes the basis of religious authority. Is belief in inspiration faith-based, evidence-based, or culturally inherited? How can one confirm divine authorship apart from tradition?</p></details>
<details><summary>How do we know the Bible wasn’t altered by humans?</summary><p>Throughout history, translations, interpretations, and edits have shaped scripture. If the Bible was divinely given, how can human transmission of the Bible avoid distortion over time?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why are there <a href="https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/first/contra2_list.html" target="new">contradictions</a> in scripture?</summary><p>Contradictions—chronological, theological, and factual—appear in the Bible. Are these due to human error, evolving belief systems, or interpretive limitations?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do so many cultures and religions have their own “holy books”?</summary><p>This suggests that scripture may be more human than divine. Do these texts reflect universal spiritual insight—or culturally constructed paths to meaning?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it fair to base eternal consequences on understanding or accepting one particular scripture?</summary><p>If access to truth determines salvation, then those born in the wrong time or place are disadvantaged. Does this align with a just and merciful deity?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why are there <a href="https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/detaillist.php?cid=3&pub=1" target="new">verses in the Bible</a> that condone slavery, misogyny, and genocide?</summary><p>These passages challenge the moral consistency of scripture. Are these reflections of divine will, or human cultural norms later codified into sacred text? How should modern believers interpret them?</p></details>
<details><summary>How do we decide which biblical commands are factual or metaphorical?</summary><p>This question confronts interpretive authority. If believers must selectively apply scripture, by what criteria do they determine which verses transcend time?</p></details>
<details><summary>Can the Bible be considered perfect if humans selected which books would be in it?</summary><p>This probes the canonization process (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent" target="new">Council of Trent</a>). If fallible human councils determined inclusion, how can we claim the Bible as a flawless whole?</p></details>

<h2 id="god">God’s Nature & Attributes</h2>
<details><summary>How can a God have emotions, such as jealousy, anger, regret, and happiness, and still remain unchanged and perfect?</summary><p>This question explores the tension between divine immutability and emotional responsiveness. How can God remain unchanging while displaying reactive traits that suggest change?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God require worship?</summary><p>If God is self-sufficient and lacks nothing, why demand praise? This question probes whether worship serves God's needs or ours, and whether it reflects divine ego or human psychology.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a God create beings capable of eternal suffering?</summary><p>This raises ethical concerns about the creator's intent. Is the possibility of eternal torment justified by the gift of free will, or does this indicate a flaw in divine design?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why is God hidden? Why not reveal Himself clearly to all people?</summary><p>The hiddenness of God poses a major obstacle to belief. If God desires a relationship and belief, why is His presence ambiguous, subjective, or historically limited?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a perfect God create an imperfect world?</summary><p>This touches on the origin of evil and suffering. Does imperfection serve a purpose, or does it reveal a deeper inconsistency in divine design?</p></details>
<details><summary>If God desires that we know the truth, why allow so many conflicting religious experiences?</summary><p>This raises epistemological concerns. If God is one and unchanging, why do people report such widely different and contradictory encounters with the divine?</p></details>

<h2 id="jesus">Jesus, Salvation & Atonement</h2>
<details><summary>Why was Jesus' death necessary for salvation?</summary><p>This question probes the logic of substitutionary atonement. If God is all-powerful and forgiving, why was a blood sacrifice required to restore humanity?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why couldn’t God simply forgive sin without a blood sacrifice?</summary><p>This invites us to examine whether divine justice is bound by cosmic law—or whether the crucifixion reflects a theological framework shaped by ancient rituals.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it just to punish one person (Jesus) for the sins of others?</summary><p>This highlights moral concerns about vicarious punishment. Would such justice be acceptable in any other context, and how does divine justice differ?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why must belief in Jesus be the only way to salvation?</summary><p>Exclusivity claims raise ethical and theological dilemmas. What about those born outside Christianity, or those who never encountered its message?</p></details>
<details><summary>What happens to those who never heard of Jesus?</summary><p>This underscores the issue of divine fairness. Can someone be judged by standards they were never exposed to? If not, what does that imply about the requirement for belief?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would Jesus allow for so many different interpretations of his message?</summary><p>The existence of denominational splits and doctrinal disagreements raises questions about clarity. Was the message inherently ambiguous, or is this a product of human interference?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why did Jesus teach in parables if he wanted people to understand?</summary><p>Parables invite interpretation but can obscure meaning. Was this teaching method effective—or intentionally exclusive?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would God allow Jesus' message to be spread by flawed human institutions?</summary><p>This question confronts historical corruption and distortion. If the message is sacred, why entrust it to fallible, and sometimes exploitative, human systems? This also raises questions about God's omniscience: If God is all-knowing, why allow his message to be spread by humans who might distort or fail to accept it?</p></details>

<h2 id="religion">Religion, Culture & Exclusivity</h2>
<details><summary>Why are there thousands of religions if there is only one true God?</summary><p>The existence of countless belief systems suggests either widespread human confusion—or cultural adaptation to universal questions. Why would one divine truth manifest in such different forms across cultures and societies?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do most people adopt the religion of their parents or region?</summary><p>This points to the role of upbringing and geography in belief. If truth is universal, shouldn’t it transcend cultural inheritance?</p></details>
<details><summary>Can all religions be wrong? Can only one be right?</summary><p>This classic question challenges exclusivism. If each faith claims ultimate truth, are we left with contradiction—or do they reflect different aspects of something greater?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do religious doctrines evolve with culture, even if they are said to come from an unchanging God?</summary><p>Religious doctrines often shift with societal values. Does this reflect divine flexibility, human reinterpretation, or a departure from original teachings?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why has religion caused so much war and division?</summary><p>Religion is often invoked in conflict—yet claims to promote peace. Is religion misused to justify conflict, or is tribalism embedded in its structure?</p></details>
<details><summary>Are religions created more for control than truth?</summary><p>This probes the sociopolitical function of religion. Do religious systems emerge to regulate behavior and power—or to uncover spiritual reality?</p></details>
<details><summary>If religious leaders have been corrupt throughout history, how can we trust religious teachings?</summary><p>This highlights the challenge of separating the message from the messenger. Can we trust religious teachings if religious leaders have been corrupt throughout history?</p></details>

<h2 id="faith">Faith, Doubt & Reason</h2>
<details><summary>Why is faith considered a virtue?</summary><p>Faith is often praised despite its lack of empirical support. To rely solely on faith is to concede a lack of confidence or truthful acceptance.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can faith lead us to truth if all religions require it?</summary><p>When opposing worldviews rely on faith, how can it be a reliable guide to truth? Does faith validate everything—or fail to guide us to truth?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why are doubts treated as rebellion rather than curiosity?</summary><p>Many religious communities see questioning as dangerous. Shouldn’t truth be able to withstand scrutiny?</p></details>
<details><summary>Shouldn’t a God who values truth encourage seeking evidence rather than suppressing inquiry?</summary><p>If truth leads to belief, why not empower seekers through reason and evidence?</p></details>
<details><summary>If truth sets us free, why fear questions?</summary><p>This question explores the tension between theological security and intellectual freedom. Shouldn’t open inquiry be welcomed, not feared?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why is it hard to believe without evidence?</summary><p>Skepticism isn't a flaw—it’s a rational function. Should belief require suspending this faculty?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is conviction more important than logical consistency?</summary><p>Or does doubt offer a rational response to contradictions in theological claims?</p></details>
<details><summary>If salvation depends on belief, shouldn’t the evidence be clear and compelling?</summary><p>If our eternal fate hinges on belief, shouldn’t the case for belief be compelling and unambiguous?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do religious experiences often contradict each other across cultures?</summary><p>Are they divine, psychological, or influenced by tradition and expectation?</p></details>
<details><summary>If belief is essential, why make the evidence so difficult to find, or reliant on cultural context?</summary><p>If God wants belief, why make it so difficult?</p></details>

<h2 id="evil">Divine Action, Evil & Suffering</h2>
<details><summary>Why does God allow evil to exist?</summary><p>If God is all-good and all-powerful, why permit so much pain and injustice? Does evil serve a higher good, or is it a sign of divine absence or limitation?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do the innocent suffer while the wicked prosper?</summary><p>Does divine justice operate in this life, the next, or not at all? Is suffering a test, a mystery, or simply unjust?</p></details>
<details><summary>Could God create beings who freely choose good?</summary><p>If God values free will, why not instill an inclination toward only good choices? This raises the question of whether moral freedom requires the possibility of evil.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why doesn’t God intervene more in human affairs?</summary><p>Is God passive, patient, or absent? This question examines divine silence in situations where intervention seems both possible and necessary.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God answer some prayers but not others?</summary><p>Does selective divine response suggest favoritism or inefficacy? Is prayer a form of communication, or simply an internal practice mistaken for dialogue?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is God testing us? If so, why test those He already knows?</summary><p>If God is omniscient, what purpose does testing serve? This challenges the idea that trials are divine assessments when the outcome is already known.</p></details>
<details><summary>If God created everything, did He create evil?</summary><p>If God created everything, did He also create evil? Or is evil not a thing, but the absence of good?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a loving God design disease, parasites, and disasters?</summary><p>Nature is often cruel. Does this reflect intelligent design, evolutionary necessity, or the indifferent mechanics of a world set in motion and left alone?</p></details>

<h2 id="miracles">Miracles, Revelation & History</h2>
<details><summary>Why are miracles mostly reported in ancient times?</summary><p>This raises the question of credibility and documentation. Are ancient miracle claims simply less scrutinized, or were people more likely to interpret events supernaturally due to limited scientific understanding?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why don’t we see clear modern miracles today?</summary><p>In an age of global media and technology, verifiable miracles seem notably absent. Does this suggest divine restraint, or were miracles always matters of perspective? A severed head or a reattached arm would provide clear evidence of divine intervention.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can we trust historical claims of miracles?</summary><p>Historical miracle accounts often rely on oral tradition or biased sources. Should we accept such claims without the kind of verification we demand for modern-day events?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God speak more to some people than others?</summary><p>If divine communication is essential, why is it unevenly distributed? Does God favor certain individuals, or are these experiences purely psychological?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why reveal Himself in obscure, ancient texts?</summary><p>Why would a timeless God choose to anchor His message in culturally and linguistically specific documents, inaccessible to many without training or translation?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does revelation always match local culture and time?</summary><p>This suggests that what’s considered divine truth may be shaped by social context. Does this reflect genuine adaptation, or is it human projection?</p></details>
<details><summary>Could divine revelation be a human psychological experience?</summary><p>Revelations often mirror the expectations of the recipient. Could they be internal rather than external events—expressions of the subconscious rather than supernatural?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why doesn’t God communicate directly with everyone?</summary><p>If belief is vital, wouldn't direct, universal communication be more just? Why rely on intermediaries, ancient texts, or ambiguous signs?</p></details>

<h2 id="afterlife">Judgment, Afterlife & Purpose</h2>
<details><summary>Why does God need to judge us if He already knows all?</summary><p>If God is omniscient, judgment seems redundant. Is judgment for our benefit or simply symbolic? This question explores whether divine justice is performative, corrective, or necessary.</p></details>
<details><summary>What is the purpose of life according to God?</summary><p>This question opens up a grand teleological inquiry: Is our purpose to serve, worship, evolve, or something else entirely? And if the purpose is known, why isn't it made universally clear?</p></details>
<details><summary>Would people still worship God if there were no heaven or hell?</summary><p>This challenges the motive behind worship. If consequences were removed, would reverence persist—or fade? Is devotion genuine, or is it incentive-driven?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it moral to believe in God only for reward or fear of punishment?</summary><p>This question evaluates the ethics of belief: Does belief rooted in self-interest reflect true faith, or is it merely transactional compliance?</p></details>

<h2 id="colonization">Religion, Identity, & Colonization</h2>
<p style="font-style:italic; color:#555; margin-top:-10px;">
Throughout history, religious belief has often been shaped by conquest, colonization, and cultural dominance. This section explores critical questions about how identity, faith, and historical forces intertwine—and asks whether our inherited beliefs truly reflect theological truths, ancestral values, or the legacies of power.
</p>
<details><summary>What was wrong with our African gods?</summary>
<p>We are all from Africa. If faith alone justifies belief, why were our ancestral spiritual systems abandoned in favor of Christianity—especially under colonialism and coercion? Were our gods dismissed because they were unworthy, or because the sociopolitical forces of the time demanded it?</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Why did entire cultures abandon their native gods for foreign ones? Due to Truth?</summary>
<p>When societies already had deeply rooted beliefs and spiritual systems, what justified replacing them? Was conversion driven by truth, political domination, or survival? Likely, the latter.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>If faith validates belief, why do so many people reject the faith of their ancestors?</summary>
<p>If sincere faith is a legitimate path to truth, then why dismiss the gods our ancestors worshipped with equal conviction? Does historical conquest invalidate their beliefs—or merely replace them?</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Is it consistent to celebrate ancestral pride while worshipping colonial gods?</summary>
<p>Many express pride in their cultural heritage while adhering to religions introduced through colonization. Is this a reclamation—or a contradiction?</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Do religions spread because they are true—or because they are powerful?</summary>
<p>The global expansion of religions often coincided with military conquest, trade, and colonial rule. How much of religious dominance reflects spiritual truth, and how much reflects human politics?</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Can theology be decolonized?</summary>
<p>If religious frameworks were historically entangled with oppression and colonization, is it possible—or necessary—to disentangle faith from that legacy? What would a truly decolonized spirituality look like?</p>
</details>
<details><summary>How should we view gods that were abandoned under force?</summary>
<p>Are forgotten deities and ancestral beliefs less valid because they were supplanted, or are they victims of historical circumstance rather than theological error?</p>
</details>
