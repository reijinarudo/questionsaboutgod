    <h2>Critical Questions About God</h2>

    <h3 id="freewill">Free Will & Divine Plan</h3>
<ol class="question-list">
  <details><summary>If God has a divine plan for the Universe, how does man have free will?</summary><p>This question raises the logical tension between determinism (everything follows God's plan) and libertarian free will (humans making independent choices). If our choices are known and fixed by divine design, is choice meaningful?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If God is omniscient and knows our choices before we make them, is free will an illusion?</summary><p>This challenges the compatibility of divine foreknowledge with genuine freedom. If God knows the future infallibly, are we still free to act otherwise?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why would God create people that he knew would go to hell?</summary><p>This question addresses the moral responsibility of an omniscient creator who knowingly brings people into existence destined for damnation. Why create those individuals at all?</p></details>
  <details><summary>How can prayer affect outcomes if God's will is unchangeable?</summary><p>If God has a divine plan that is perfect and unalterable, how can prayers influence real-world events without contradicting divine immutability?</p></details>
</ol>

    <h3 id="hell">Hell, Morality, & Justice</h3>
<ol class="question-list" start="3">
  <details><summary>Can Heaven be blissful if loved ones are in Hell?</summary><p>This addresses the moral dissonance between eternal joy and awareness of eternal suffering. Could a person truly enjoy Heaven knowing a parent or child suffers forever?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why would a loving God punish people eternally?</summary><p>This critiques the proportionality and justice of infinite punishment for finite human actions, especially when ignorance or upbringing could influence belief.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Is Hell a place of eternal conscious torment, and if so, how is that just?</summary><p>If justice requires proportionality, how can eternal suffering be a fair response to finite human errors?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Wouldn't it be more merciful to annihilate sinners rather than torture them forever?</summary><p>This reflects on alternative doctrines like annihilationism, questioning whether endless punishment serves any just or moral purpose.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why not simply forgive everyone, especially if God knows our hearts and limitations?</summary><p>If human justice takes intent and mental health into account, shouldn't divine justice be even more compassionate?</p></details>
</ol>

    <h3 id="bible">The Bible & Revelation</h3>
    <ol class="question-list" start="5">
      <details><summary>How do we know the Bible wasn’t altered by humans?</summary><p>Many religious adherents claim their scriptures are divinely preserved. Yet historical evidence suggests changes, translations, and omissions. Can divine truth be entrusted to imperfect scribes?</p></details>
      <details><summary>Why are there contradictions in scripture?</summary><p>If the Bible is the infallible word of God, why do we find inconsistencies in timelines, genealogies, and moral teachings across its books? Are these signs of human hands or divine paradox?</p></details>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="god">God’s Nature</h3>
    <ol class="question-list" start="7">
      <details><summary>How can God have emotions if He is perfect and unchanging?</summary><p>Emotions imply change and reaction. If God is immutable, how can He feel anger, regret, or love without being influenced by creation?</p></details>
      <details><summary>Why would an omnipotent being need worship?</summary><p>Does an all-powerful, self-sufficient deity desire or demand praise for its own sake—or is worship for the worshipper’s benefit? And if so, why make it mandatory?</p></details>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="jesus">Jesus, Atonement & Salvation</h3>
<ol class="question-list" start="9">
  <details><summary>Why was a blood sacrifice necessary for forgiveness?</summary><p>This question asks why a supposedly loving God would require the violent death of an innocent being to forgive sins. Couldn’t an all-powerful deity simply forgive without ritualized suffering?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why is belief in Jesus more important than moral behavior?</summary><p>This challenges salvation through faith over works. Can someone who is kind and ethical be condemned for disbelief, while a cruel person is rewarded for belief?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why is salvation based on geography and access to certain teachings?</summary><p>People born into different cultures are far less likely to hear the gospel. Does that make their salvation contingent on luck or birth?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If Jesus is God, why did he pray to himself?</summary><p>This raises questions about the doctrine of the Trinity. If Jesus is fully God, why does he communicate with the Father in ways that imply separation?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why does salvation depend on accepting unverifiable historical claims?</summary><p>Faith in Jesus’ resurrection is central to Christianity. But how can eternal destiny depend on accepting something that lacks direct evidence today?</p></details>
</ol>

    <h3 id="religion">Religion & Exclusivity</h3>
<ol class="question-list" start="11">
  <details><summary>Why are there thousands of denominations claiming truth?</summary><p>If God is not the author of confusion, why does Christianity appear so divided—each group claiming divine guidance?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why didn’t God reveal Himself universally to all people?</summary><p>If God desires a relationship with all of humanity, why do revelations seem regionally and culturally specific, often inaccessible to many?</p></details>
  <details><summary>How can one religion be true if others make the same exclusive claims?</summary><p>This question explores religious pluralism and the issue of conflicting truth-claims. Can they all be wrong? Can only one be right?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Does religion evolve with culture, or is it fixed by divine will?</summary><p>Do moral progress and shifting doctrines suggest divine flexibility—or merely human reinterpretation over time?</p></details>
</ol>

    <h3 id="faith">Faith vs. Evidence</h3>
<ol class="question-list" start="13">
  <details><summary>Why does God require faith instead of evidence?</summary><p>This challenges the nature of belief itself. Should eternal destinies hinge on belief without verification?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If faith is key, why do some believe so easily while others struggle?</summary><p>This raises questions of fairness and predisposition. Does God favor those more emotionally or culturally inclined to believe?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why are those who question or doubt punished while those who blindly believe are rewarded?</summary><p>Shouldn’t thoughtful examination be encouraged rather than condemned if truth is the goal?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Can faith be a reliable path to truth if every religion uses it to justify opposing beliefs?</summary><p>This explores epistemology—how we know what we claim to know. Can faith alone discern truth?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If God wants a relationship, why remain hidden and communicate through ancient texts?</summary><p>Why would a timeless being use culturally limited means to convey eternal truths?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why are miracles and divine communication absent in modern, well-documented eras?</summary><p>Do improved documentation standards expose divine silence or filter out wishful interpretations?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why does God allow so much religious confusion if salvation depends on correct belief?</summary><p>This calls into question the clarity of God's message and the consequences of honest misinterpretation.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why are critical thinkers or skeptics often portrayed as evil or rebellious in scripture?</summary><p>This suggests that seeking evidence might be viewed as sinful, even though it's essential to science and reason.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Shouldn't a just God welcome honest inquiry instead of punishing doubt?</summary><p>If questioning leads to understanding, would discouraging it not hinder spiritual growth?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If the truth will set us free, why discourage asking hard questions about God?</summary><p>Is truth something fragile or something that can withstand honest scrutiny?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why is spiritual certainty praised when it may prevent exploration of deeper truth?</summary><p>This questions whether confidence in belief sometimes discourages openness to new understanding.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Does the concept of faith override the need for reason and evidence in the pursuit of truth?</summary><p>Should belief rest on trust, logic, or both—and how do we navigate their limits?</p></details>
  <details><summary>How can one differentiate between true divine inspiration and strong personal conviction?</summary><p>This considers the psychological and cultural influences that mimic divine prompting.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Is believing something without sufficient evidence considered a virtue or a flaw?</summary><p>Depending on the context, faith can be celebrated or viewed as gullibility. Which is it in the divine sense?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Can we be held morally accountable for beliefs shaped by culture, geography, or trauma?</summary><p>If belief is influenced by environment and experience, should salvation hinge on overcoming those?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If a just God values truth, why not equip everyone with the same access to knowledge?</summary><p>Would true fairness require a level playing field in terms of spiritual understanding and access?</p></details>
</ol>
  <h3 id="additional">Miracles, Divine Action & Violence</h3>
<ol class="question-list" start="57">
  <details><summary>Why does God only seem to perform miracles in ancient times or undocumented regions?</summary><p>If God intervenes today as in the past, why don't we see verifiable, documented miracles that meet modern standards of evidence?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why does God allow so much suffering if He has the power to stop it?</summary><p>This is a classic formulation of the problem of evil. If God is omnipotent and loving, why permit vast, needless suffering?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why are the worst atrocities often justified using divine commands?</summary><p>History is full of violence perpetrated in the name of God. If those were truly divine commands, what does that say about God's nature?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Does God favor some nations or people over others?</summary><p>Many scriptures suggest divine favoritism, raising questions about fairness, impartiality, and universality of love and justice.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why is slavery condoned or regulated in the Bible instead of abolished?</summary><p>Shouldn't a holy book reflect the highest moral truths, including outright condemnation of slavery?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If divine justice is perfect, why does it resemble human vengeance?</summary><p>Concepts like wrath, retribution, and eternal punishment appear anthropomorphic. Is divine justice truly transcendent?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why would a God use fear of punishment to compel belief?</summary><p>Wouldn't a loving deity inspire devotion through love and understanding rather than threats of eternal damnation?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why did God demand animal and human sacrifices in the Old Testament?</summary><p>Why would an omnibenevolent being require violent rituals to atone for sin?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why are holy texts filled with endorsements of violence and conquest?</summary><p>Do these commands reflect divine will or human ambitions justified in divine terms?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Could the idea of divine revelation be a projection of human hopes and fears?</summary><p>Many revelations seem to align with cultural needs and political goals. Might they reflect psychological or social invention more than divine truth?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why does divine intervention seem arbitrary—saving some while ignoring others?</summary><p>Why are some prayers seemingly answered while others, equally desperate, go unfulfilled?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If the universe operates on consistent natural laws, when and why does God suspend them?</summary><p>Miracles are defined as violations of natural law. Why would a perfect system require interruption?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Is it ethical to worship a being simply out of fear of punishment or hope of reward?</summary><p>Does true morality require doing good for its own sake, not because of divine consequences?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Could belief in God persist if there were no concept of afterlife?</summary><p>If no heaven or hell existed, would belief still thrive purely based on this-life benefits or truth-seeking alone?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If God created everything, did He also create evil?</summary><p>This challenges the origin of evil. If God created all that exists, where does evil come from?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why is doubt considered sinful in some traditions?</summary><p>Shouldn't doubt be part of an honest search for truth rather than treated as disobedience?</p></details>
