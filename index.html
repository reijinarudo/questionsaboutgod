  <h1>Questions About God</h1>
  <h2 id="free-will">Free Will & Divine Plan</h2>
  <details><summary>If God has a divine plan/blueprint for the Universe, how does man have free will?</summary><p>If all events are predestined, then any choice we make is merely an illusion of agency. This question highlights a tension between divine sovereignty and human autonomy. Can true responsibility exist if all outcomes are already determined?</p></details>
  <details><summary>If God knows our choices before we make them, is free will just an illusion?</summary><p>Foreknowledge may imply inevitability. If God already knows what we will choose, how can our decisions be genuinely free? This raises the philosophical problem of whether 'knowing' something causes it—or merely anticipates it.</p></details>
  <details><summary>If God already knows who is going to Heaven or Hell, why create those who are going to Hell?</summary><p>This question probes divine justice and intention. If some are born into a fate of eternal punishment, the act of creation itself could be construed as cruel or unnecessary—unless there's some higher justification we’re not privy to.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Can prayer change God's will? If so, how is God's will perfect and unchanging?</summary><p>This introduces a paradox: if prayer can influence God, then His will isn't fixed; if it can’t, then why pray? Either outcome seems to undermine traditional beliefs about the power of prayer or the nature of God.</p></details>
  <details><summary>If everything happens for a reason (under God's control), are we truly responsible for our actions?</summary><p>If divine orchestration governs all events, then moral accountability becomes blurred. Can we be judged for actions we were ultimately caused or destined to perform?</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why punish people for doing what you already knew they would do?</summary></details>
<h2 id="hell">Hell, Morality & Eternal Justice</h2>
<details><summary>When the believer gets to Heaven, how can Heaven be blissful if the believer's loved ones are suffering eternally in Hell?</summary><p>This question touches on the emotional paradox of eternal joy coexisting with eternal loss. Does divine bliss require emotional detachment or forgetfulness? If so, can such a Heaven be considered loving or just?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would God send anyone to Hell? Based on what?</summary><p>This raises questions about divine justice and moral thresholds. What actions, beliefs, or lack thereof merit infinite punishment? Is there room for reform, or is the sentence final?</p></details>
<details><summary>"God is merciful," we hear quite often. Wouldn’t a merciful God simply forgive everyone and not send anyone to Hell?</summary><p>If mercy is unconditional, shouldn’t it extend to all? This question probes whether mercy can coexist with vengeance, or if our definitions are shaped more by tradition than consistency.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is eternal punishment just? Isn’t that overkill?</summary><p>This question scrutinizes the proportionality of divine justice. Does any finite wrongdoing warrant unending suffering? Or is this more reflective of human legalism projected onto the divine?</p></details>
<details><summary>Wouldn’t it be more merciful for God to just destroy the souls of the wicked than to burn them forever?</summary><p>This considers annihilationism as an alternative to eternal torment. Which better reflects a morally coherent deity—cessation or everlasting suffering?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is Hell a place of literal fire, or is it metaphorical? Why the imagery of fire?</summary><p>The fire motif may have metaphorical or cultural roots. Does it reflect divine wrath, purification, or a literal torment? The ambiguity leaves room for interpretation—some symbolic, others terrifyingly real.</p></details>
<details><summary>How is eternal punishment reconciled with crimes committed in finite time?</summary><p>This question scrutinizes proportionality. Can infinite consequences for limited deeds be morally justified, or does such a framework collapse under modern ethical reasoning?</p></details>

<h2 id="bible">The Bible & Revelation</h2>
<details><summary>How can we be sure the Bible is the inspired Word of God?</summary><p>This question probes the basis of religious authority. Is belief in inspiration faith-based, evidence-based, or culturally inherited? How would one confirm divine authorship apart from tradition?</p></details>
<details><summary>How do we know the Bible wasn’t altered by humans?</summary><p>Throughout history, translations, interpretations, and edits have shaped scripture. If the Bible was divinely given, how can its human transmission avoid distortion over time?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why are there contradictions in scripture?</summary><p>Contradictions—chronological, theological, and factual—appear in the Bible. Are these due to human error, evolving belief systems, or interpretive limitations?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do so many cultures and religions have their own “holy books”?</summary><p>This suggests that the phenomenon of scripture may be more human than divine. Do these texts reflect universal spiritual insight—or culturally constructed paths to meaning?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it fair to base eternal consequences on understanding or accepting one particular scripture?</summary><p>If access to truth determines salvation, then those born in the wrong time or place are disadvantaged. Does this align with a just and merciful deity?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why are there verses in the Bible that condone slavery, misogyny, and genocide?</summary><p>These passages challenge the moral consistency of scripture. Are these reflections of divine will, or human cultural norms later codified into sacred text? How should modern believers interpret them?</p></details>
<details><summary>How do we decide which biblical commands are cultural and which are eternal?</summary><p>This question confronts interpretive authority. If believers must selectively apply scripture, by what criteria do they determine which verses transcend time?</p></details>
<details><summary>Can the Bible be considered perfect if humans selected which books would be in it?</summary><p>This probes the canonization process. If fallible human councils determined inclusion, how can we claim the Bible as a flawless whole?</p></details>

<h2 id="god">God’s Nature & Attributes</h2>
<details><summary>How can a God have emotions, i.e. jealousy, anger, regret, happiness, etc., and yet remain unchanged and perfect?</summary><p>This question addresses the philosophical tension between divine immutability and emotional responsiveness. How can God remain unchanged while exhibiting reactive traits that imply change?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God require worship?</summary><p>If God is self-sufficient and lacks nothing, why demand praise? This question probes whether worship serves God's needs—or ours—and whether divine ego or human psychology is at play.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a God create beings capable of eternal suffering?</summary><p>This raises ethical concerns about the creator's intent. Is the possibility of eternal torment justified by the gift of free will, or does it reflect a troubling design flaw?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why is God hidden? Why not reveal Himself clearly to all people?</summary><p>The hiddenness of God is a major obstacle for belief. If God desires relationship and belief, why is His presence ambiguous, subjective, or historically limited?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a perfect God create an imperfect world?</summary><p>This touches on the origin of evil and suffering. Does imperfection serve a purpose, or does it point to a deeper inconsistency in divine design?</p></details>
<details><summary>If God is just, why is life so unfair?</summary><p>Life’s injustices challenge the notion of divine fairness. Is suffering due to human free will, divine testing, or something we simply cannot understand?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God allow so many conflicting religious experiences?</summary><p>This raises epistemological concerns. If God is one and unchanging, why do people report such wildly different and contradictory encounters with the divine?</p></details>

<h2 id="jesus">Jesus, Salvation & Atonement</h2>
<details><summary>Why was Jesus' death necessary for salvation?</summary><p>This question probes the logic of substitutionary atonement. If God is all-powerful and forgiving, why was a blood sacrifice required to restore humanity?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why couldn’t God simply forgive sin without a blood sacrifice?</summary><p>This invites us to examine whether divine justice is bound by cosmic law—or whether the crucifixion reflects a theological framework shaped by ancient rituals.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it just to punish one person (Jesus) for the sins of others?</summary><p>This highlights moral concerns about vicarious punishment. Would such justice be acceptable in any other context, and how does divine justice differ?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why must belief in Jesus be the only way to salvation?</summary><p>Exclusivity claims raise ethical and theological dilemmas. What about those born outside Christianity, or those who never encountered its message?</p></details>
<details><summary>What happens to those who never heard of Jesus?</summary><p>This underscores the issue of divine fairness. Can someone be judged by standards they were never exposed to? If not, what does that imply about the requirement for belief?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would Jesus allow for so many different interpretations of his message?</summary><p>The existence of denominational splits and doctrinal disagreements raises questions about clarity. Was the message inherently ambiguous, or is this a product of human interference?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why did Jesus teach in parables if he wanted people to understand?</summary><p>Parables invite interpretation but can obscure meaning. Was this teaching method effective—or intentionally exclusive?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would God allow Jesus' message to be spread by flawed human institutions?</summary><p>This question confronts historical corruption and distortion. If the message is sacred, why entrust it to fallible, and sometimes exploitative, human systems?</p></details>

<h2 id="religion">Religion, Culture & Exclusivity</h2>
<details><summary>Why are there thousands of religions if there is only one true God?</summary><p>The existence of countless belief systems suggests either widespread human confusion—or cultural adaptation to universal questions. Why would one divine truth manifest in such varied forms?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do most people adopt the religion of their parents or region?</summary><p>This points to the role of upbringing and geography in belief. If truth is universal, shouldn’t it transcend cultural inheritance?</p></details>
<details><summary>Can all religions be wrong? Can only one be right?</summary><p>This classic question challenges exclusivism. If each faith claims ultimate truth, are we left with contradiction—or do they reflect different aspects of something greater?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do religions evolve with culture if their teachings come from an unchanging God?</summary><p>Religious doctrines often shift with societal values. Does this reflect divine flexibility, human reinterpretation, or a departure from original teachings?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why has religion caused so much war and division?</summary><p>Religion is often invoked in conflict—yet claims to promote peace. Is this a misuse of faith, or is tribalism built into its structure?</p></details>
<details><summary>Are religions created more for control than truth?</summary><p>This probes the sociopolitical function of religion. Do religious systems emerge to regulate behavior and power—or to uncover spiritual reality?</p></details>
<details><summary>If religious leaders have been corrupt throughout history, how can we trust religious teachings?</summary><p>This highlights the challenge of separating message from messenger. Can divine truth survive human failure?</p></details>

<h2 id="faith">Faith, Doubt & Reason</h2>
<details><summary>Why is faith considered a virtue?</summary><p>Faith is often praised despite its lack of empirical support. Is this a strength of conviction—or a vulnerability to deception?</p></details>
<details><summary>Can faith lead us to truth if all religions require it?</summary><p>When opposing worldviews rely on faith, how can it be a reliable guide to truth? Does faith validate everything—or nothing?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why are doubts treated as rebellion rather than curiosity?</summary><p>Many religious communities see questioning as dangerous. But shouldn’t truth be able to withstand scrutiny?</p></details>
<details><summary>Shouldn’t seeking evidence be encouraged by a God who values truth?</summary><p>If truth leads to belief, why not empower seekers through reason and evidence rather than suppress their inquiries?</p></details>
<details><summary>If truth sets us free, why fear questions?</summary><p>This question probes the tension between theological security and intellectual freedom. Shouldn’t open inquiry be welcomed, not feared?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why is it hard to believe without evidence?</summary><p>This recognizes that skepticism isn’t a flaw—it’s a function of reason. Should belief require suspension of that very faculty?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it wrong to doubt what seems irrational?</summary><p>Should conviction be stronger than coherence? Or is doubt a rational response to theological contradictions?</p></details>
<details><summary>If salvation depends on belief, shouldn’t the evidence be undeniable?</summary><p>If our eternal fate hinges on what we believe, shouldn’t the case for belief be compelling and unambiguous?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do religious experiences contradict each other?</summary><p>Personal religious experiences vary across cultures. Are they divine, psychological, or filtered through tradition and expectation?</p></details>
<details><summary>If God wants belief, why make it so difficult?</summary><p>This returns to the hiddenness of God. If belief is essential, why obscure the evidence—or make it dependent on cultural luck?</p></details>

<h2 id="evil">Divine Action, Evil & Suffering</h2>
<details><summary>Why does God allow evil to exist?</summary><p>This is perhaps the most enduring challenge to theism. If God is all-good and all-powerful, why permit so much pain and injustice? Does evil serve a higher good, or is its presence a sign of divine absence or limitation?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do the innocent suffer while the wicked prosper?</summary><p>This question confronts moral imbalance. Does divine justice operate in this life, the next, or not at all? Is this suffering part of a test, a mystery, or simply unjust?</p></details>
<details><summary>Could God create beings who freely choose good?</summary><p>If God values free will, could He not also instill an inclination toward only good choices? This asks whether moral freedom necessarily entails the possibility of evil.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why doesn’t God intervene more in human affairs?</summary><p>Is God passive, patient, or absent? This question probes the silence of the divine in crises where intervention would seem both possible and warranted.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God answer some prayers but not others?</summary><p>Selective divine response suggests favoritism or inefficacy. Is prayer a form of communication, or merely an internal practice misunderstood as a dialogue?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is God testing us? If so, why test those He already knows?</summary><p>If God is omniscient, what purpose does testing serve? This challenges the idea of trials as divine assessments when the outcome is already known.</p></details>
<details><summary>If God created everything, did He create evil?</summary><p>This question dives into metaphysics. If evil exists, must it have a creator? Or is evil not a thing, but the absence of good?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why would a loving God design disease, parasites, and disasters?</summary><p>Nature is often cruel. Does this reflect intelligent design, evolutionary necessity, or the indifferent mechanics of a world set in motion and left alone?</p></details>

<h2 id="miracles">Miracles, Revelation & History</h2>
<details><summary>Why are miracles mostly reported in ancient times?</summary><p>This raises the question of credibility and documentation. Are ancient miracle claims simply less scrutinized, or were people more inclined to interpret events supernaturally due to limited scientific understanding?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why don’t we see clear modern miracles today?</summary><p>In an age of global media and technology, verifiable miracles seem notably absent. Does this suggest divine restraint—or that miracles were always matters of perspective?</p></details>
<details><summary>Can we trust historical claims of miracles?</summary><p>Historical miracle accounts often rely on oral tradition or biased sources. Should such claims be accepted without the kind of verification we demand today?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does God speak more to some people than others?</summary><p>If divine communication is essential, why is it unevenly distributed? Does God favor certain individuals—or are such experiences purely psychological?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why reveal Himself in obscure, ancient texts?</summary><p>Why would a timeless God choose to anchor His message in culturally and linguistically specific documents, inaccessible to many without training or translation?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does revelation always match local culture and time?</summary><p>This suggests that what’s considered divine truth may be shaped by social context. Does this reflect genuine adaptation—or human projection?</p></details>
<details><summary>Could divine revelation be a human psychological experience?</summary><p>Revelations often mirror the expectations of the recipient. Could they be internal rather than external events—expressions of the subconscious rather than supernatural?</p></details>
<details><summary>Why doesn’t God communicate directly with everyone?</summary><p>If belief is vital, wouldn't direct, universal communication be more just? Why rely on intermediaries, ancient texts, or ambiguous signs?</p></details>

<h2 id="afterlife">Judgment, Afterlife & Purpose</h2>
<details><summary>Why does God need to judge us if He already knows all?</summary><p>If God is omniscient, judgment appears redundant. Is the judgment for our benefit or symbolic? This question explores whether divine justice is performative, corrective, or necessary at all.</p></details>
<details><summary>What is the purpose of life according to God?</summary><p>This question opens up the grand teleological inquiry. Is our purpose to serve, worship, evolve, or something else entirely? And if known, why isn't that purpose made universally clear?</p></details>
<details><summary>Would people still worship God if there were no heaven or hell?</summary><p>This challenges the motive behind worship. If consequences were removed, would reverence persist—or fade? Is devotion genuine or incentive-driven?</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it moral to believe in God only for reward or fear of punishment?</summary><p>This question evaluates the ethics of belief. Does belief grounded in self-interest reflect true faith—or transactional compliance?</p></details>
